## Clean Code - A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship.

### Intro
Hi! I'm Gabriel, I'm a software developer with a passion for cybersecurity. I'm looking to improve my English writing skills, and to do so, I plan to share insights from each chapter of the book 'Clean Code' that I've been reading lately.

#### Chapter one - Clean Code
Before starting chapter one, the Author - Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bobby - makes it clear that this book cannot be read in less of 12 hours or in 30 days. Instead, it will take months to be completed, because readers need to commit to it. This book offers great lessons on being a good programmer.

Chapter none delves deeply into the concept of "clean code," presenting various viewpoints from well-known programmers. Before understanding what clean code entails, it's crucial to grasp its counterpart - bad code. <br>

Bad code can significantly decrease team productivity and make you question your career choices. Worse yet, it might even bring your business down.

So, what are the characteristics of bad code?
- Lack of understanding of project requirements.
- Absence of clear thoughts reflected in the code.
- Inconsistent code and lack of standardized patterns.
- Absence of testing.
- Neglect of important details.
- Excessive resource usage for simple tasks.

So what's the deal? <br>
In fact, cleand code needs to be ingrained in software development culture. When we talk about 'culture,' we are referring to 'people.' Keeping code clean isn't just about maintaining its beauty; it's about ensuring that another developer can easily understand and modify your code in the future.

#### Chapter Two - Meaninful Names
Making progress in my writing lessons. In this chapter I'm going to introduce an important topic in software development (coding) - meaningful names. We well know that a names have a meaning to someone, a group of people and even in the society. For example, 
The name "Rafael" means "God has healed" or "God heals." It originates from Hebrew and is derived from the elements "rafa," meaning "healing," and "el," meaning "God." Therefore, "Rafael" signifies a divine healing or God's healing.

<br>
Another example is the name "Marina", Marina means "of the sea" or "belonging to the sea" or "marine", therefore "Marina" coveys the idea of being related to or associated with the sea.
So, as we can see above, these two names have different meanings, bringing themselves diffent <b>contexts.
