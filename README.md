### Clean Code - A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship <br>By Robert C. Martin

#### Chapter one: Clean Code
There Will be Code:
- In this section the author explained that code should not be the issue. 
- We should be concerned about models and requirements.
- The code represents the details of the requirements.
 -- The details should not be ignored or abastracted.
- The future tecnhologies, for example ML or AI will not be able to replace A GOOD PROGRAMMER. Because code should be accurate, rigorous and continue be a piece of work for the devs! Actually, we might have come up with technhologies that help us out in define the specifications and requirements of our projects (CHATGPT, it's a good example nowadays).

Bad Code:
- A bad code bring a company down.
- reasons of why bad code can arise: 
 - Preasure due the task deadline.
- put off code review and testing until tomorray what you should do today. (LeBlanc's laws - Later equals never)

The total Cost of Owning a Mess:
Bad codes can turn into a big monster. So when the devs have to face this big monster their productivity decrease approch to zero. The managers try to increase the team productivity adding more and more task on backlog.


Attitude:
- Devs should not be shy. The should step foward and say what they think about the project, the schedule and the deadlines. The managers do yarns for the truth, because the managers and marketers makes promisses and commitments with the customers. But before we start a project we must show our resources to the managers.

Clean Code:
There are many definitions of clean code to many programmers. The author asked about well-known and depeply experienced programmers what they thought. After saw many views of points, I could realize that clean some topics of keeps clean your code: Code should be simple. It should be readable like a book. It should have tests cases and these test should be testing. It should be indent.
