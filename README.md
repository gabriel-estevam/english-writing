## Clean Code - A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship.

### Intro
Hi! I'm Gabriel, I'm a software developer with a passion for cybersecurity. I'm looking to improve my English writing skills, and to do so, I plan to share insights from each chapter of the book 'Clean Code' that I've been reading lately.

#### Chapter one - Clean Code
Before starting chapter one, the Author - Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bobby - makes it clear that this book cannot be read in less of 12 hours or in 30 days. Instead, it will take months to be completed, because readers need to commit to it. This book offers great lessons on being a good programmer.

Chapter one brings a deep reflection around what "clean code" is, presenting various viewpoints from well-known programmers. Before we understand what clean code is, we need to understand its opposite - bad code. A bad code can increable decrease the team's productivity, your starting thing of w how a good phiphlofer you would be if you give up your careers. And even worst thing is, you I might take your business down because of bad code.
So, what is the caracteritic that fills a bad code?
- Do not understand the project requirements.
- Say nothing about yours thoughts of the project.
- Never standize the code and patterns.
- Never testing your code.
- Never care about the details
- Use a whole of resources to do a tiny thing.

So what's the deal?
Matter of fact, clean code need to be culture in software development. When we say "culture" we have "people".
