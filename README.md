### Clean Code - A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship <br>By Robert C. Martin

#### Chapter one: Clean Code
There Will be Code:
- In this section the author explained that code should not be the issue. 
- We should be concerned about models and requirements.
- The code represents the details of the requirements.
 -- The details should not be ignored or abastracted.
- The future tecnhologies, for example ML or AI will not be able to replace A GOOD PROGRAMMER. Because code should be accurate, rigorous and continue be a piece of work for the devs! Actually, we might have come up with technhologies that help us out in define the specifications and requirements of our projects (CHATGPT, it's a good example nowadays).

Bad Code:
- A bad code bring a company down.
- reasons of why bad code can arise: 
 - Preasure due the task deadline.
- put off code review and testing until tomorray what you should do today. (LeBlanc's laws - Later equals never)
